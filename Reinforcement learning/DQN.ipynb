        "## Starter Code Explanation\n",
        "In addition to code you are already familiar with from the previous project (i.e. arm dynamics, etc.) we are providing an \"Environment\" in the `ArmEnv` class. The environment \"wraps around\" the arm dynamics and provides the key functions that an RL algorithm expects: reset(...) and step(...). The implementation of `ArmEnv` follows the [OpenAI Gym](https://www.gymlibrary.dev/api/core/) API standard. It is a standard that is accepeted by many RL libraries and allows for our problem to be easily solved with various RL libraries. Take a moment to familiarize yourself with these functions! See [here](https://www.gymlibrary.dev/api/core/) for more information on the definition of the reset(...) and step(...) functions.\n",
        "\n",
        "Important notes:\n",
        "\n",
        "* The ArmEnv expects an action similar to the one used previously: a vector with a torque for every arm joint. Thus, the native action space for this environment is high-dimensional, and continuous. DQN will require an action space that is 1-dimensional and discrete. You will need to convert between these. For example, you can have an action space of [0, 1, 2,] where each number just represents the identity of an action candidate, and a conversion dictionary {0: [-0.1, -0.1], 1: [0.1, 0.1], 2: [0, 0]}. Then, when the Q network output an action 1, it will be converted into [0.1, 0.1] and used by the environment. Note that this is just an example method to implement the conversion and you do not have to follow the same procedure.\n",
        "* The observation provided by the environment will comprise the same state vector as before, to which we append the current position of the end_effector and the goal for the end-effector. Since your policy must learn to reach arbitrary goals, the goal must be provided as part of the observation. So the observation will consist of 8 values: 4 for the state, 2 for the pos_ee and 2 for the goal.\n",
        "* The maximum episode length of the environment is 200 steps. Each step is simulated for 0.01 second. This should be used for both training and testing.\n",
        "* The reward function of this environment is by default r(s, a) = - dist(pos_ee, goal)^2 where represents the negative square of L2 distance between the current position of the end-effector and the goal position."

This could come handy later when training the model.\n",
